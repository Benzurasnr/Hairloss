          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What causes hair loss in men?</h3>
            <p>
              Hair loss in men is often caused by genetics (androgenetic
              alopecia), hormonal changes, stress, or medical conditions.
              Understanding the underlying cause is key to finding the right
              treatment.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are there natural remedies for hair loss?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, some natural remedies, like essential oils, scalp massages,
              and maintaining a balanced diet, can support hair health. However,
              results may vary based on the cause of hair loss.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does it take to see results from treatments?</h3>
            <p>
              The time varies depending on the treatment. Medications like
              Minoxidil may take several months, while surgical options can show
              immediate results. Consistency is crucial.
